Mango Typer is my Cs50x Final project

It's a fully frontend project built using Html, Js and Css.
Things Learned:
- How to create spans dynamically with Javascript
- Advanced Css Selectors https://flukeout.github.io This was a really nice resource
- Ui design
- Css animations
- Bunch of Javascript
- Improved my bootstrap skills
And most importantly I really had lots of fun while making it.
